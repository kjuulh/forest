Existing registry is scanned and archived\n3. A sparse graph of dependencies are downloaded, this will make it easy to traverse the full tree of items required\n4. Components not found are downloaded and moved to their proper location\n5. Each components are now fully indexed, catalogued and ready for usage for the rest of the session\n",
